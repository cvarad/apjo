# APJO: Applicative-based Parser for JSON in OCaml
APJO is a JSON parsing library written in pure OCaml using immutable data structures. At its core, it is built using the concept of [Applicatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor) and Functional Parsing.

Note: This parser was developed as a means to get used to OCaml, and to learn more about functional parsing.
